      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <blockquote class="bg-default">

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Who knew that someone with a background in veterinary medicine could take such a huge leap into tech! Well, maybe it is actually not <em>that</em> surprising... I have always been drawn to more creative side of things and my career in veterinary medicine is actually sandwiched in between working in the music industry and working in film. I have always had a very strong attention to detail, so a career using both sides of my brain definitely makes sense. Prior to working in tech I have worked the companies below as well as freelance in film doing sfx makeup and production.</p>
